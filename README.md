# Intro <a id="intro"></a>

This project has been created as a reusable React library that can be easily customized and recreated in various kinds of projects. 

It includes a variety of common-used templates, such as sliders, tabs, sidebars, galleries, navbars, etc. The main goal is to have a simple and useful repository that will be expanded with more features.

There are a few options:

You can clone the project, remove the parts that you donÂ´t want to use, customize the ones that you want and import them into App.js. 

To clone the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/BdeVallejo/react-library
```

You can also create your own React project with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and then copy and paste the raw code of the components that you wish to use. Next to each component there a css folder with the specific css code.

## Placeholders<a id="placeholders"></a>

In the folder `/utils ` there is a file that contains all the texts and files used as placeholders. You can edit them to suit your needs.

Alternatively, all components that use those placeholders include a `fetchText() ` function that you can use to fetch data from an API or similar.

A loading indicator has been added as well for this purpose.
